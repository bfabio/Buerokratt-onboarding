      **What is Bürokratt today? **


      Bürokratt is a state-created, AI-based digital assistant that helps
      institutions deliver modern and efficient customer service. Today,
      Bürokratt offers institutions the ability to use large language models
      (LLMs) to understand human-language input and respond to questions
      quickly, referentially, and around the clock.


      **Who is Bürokratt for?**


      Bürokratt is intended for people who want to communicate with the
      government. It is designed for public sector institutions that wish to
      offer user-friendly, efficient, and up-to-date customer service. It meets
      the needs of both local governments and national agencies — including
      managing information requests, automating recurring questions, and
      providing customer support.


      **Vision of Bürokratt**


      The vision for Bürokratt is to give people the opportunity to interact
      with the state as easily as with a friend — in natural language, at any
      time, and from any device. To achieve this, the chatbots deployed to
      clients will form a unified network that allows people to find answers,
      solve problems, and consume digital services directly from the chat
      window, without navigating complex portals or filling out forms.

      As this vision is realized, institutions will be able to integrate virtual
      assistants into the network — independent AI agents that cooperate with
      each other, which, based on a person’s requests, find necessary
      information and carry out required actions (e.g. submitting an inquiry,
      application, or booking). In the future, these assistants will be able to
      offer people seamless and personalized service.
